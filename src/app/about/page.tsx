              We’re building AI systems that are understandable, auditable, and designed to work with you—not around you. In a world where AI is increasingly opaque and centralized, we believe powerful intelligence should be traceable, controllable, and locally deployable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our work focuses on creating modular AI workflows that users can inspect, customize, and trust, whether they’re running on a laptop, workstation, or private infrastructure.

                <p>
                  A small team from Berkeley and Michigan focused on building transparent, local-first AI systems. Founded by Logan Sundaram, Saturday.ai grew from a desire to apply AI in domains where privacy, robustness, and accountability are critical.
